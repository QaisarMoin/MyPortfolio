            <span>
              In June of 2022, I graduated from architecture school at the
              University of Toronto. There, I became obsessed with architectural
              visualization.

            <span>
              I was deeply fascinated in the concepts of modularity and
              adaptability â€” how our built environment could organically evolve
              in conjuction with humanity.

              When the pandemic struck, I took it as an opportunity to explore
              new things. I came across UX design competitions, and thought it
              might be fun to just give it a go (several times).
